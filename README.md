# Dino-mart

Dino-mart is a full-stack ecommerce CRUD application with a Spring Boot backend (Java 24) and a React frontend. It supports product management with image upload functionality and includes a search filter in the frontend navbar for easy product discovery.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **CRUD operations** for products

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend
